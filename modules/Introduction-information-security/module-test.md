**Question 10** 1 Mark

A node that requests for data or service is called a _____________.
- [x] Client
- [ ] Server

**Correct Answer:** A. Client

If a node requests for some data or service, it is called a client, while if the node provides data or services it is called a server. For example, when you download a game from the playstation network (PSN), your playstation is the client and the computers on the PSN that are serving the game, play the role of servers i.e they accept requests, process them and return a suitable response.

**Question 11** 1 Mark

A client understands the requests, processes the requests, and then generates the responses.
- [ ]  True
- [x] False

**Correct Answer:** B. False

A server captures requests sent by the client, understands these requests, processes them, generates suitable responses and the delivers the data or service. For example, in the case of visiting google.com, you are the client and the device on the other end that processes your search request and sends you the results as response is the server.

**Question 12** 1 Mark

NAT stands for ______________.
- [ ] Network Area Transformation
- [ ] Network Area Translation
- [x] Network Address Translation

**Correct Answer:** C. Network Address Translation

NAT or Network address Translation is a methodology used to separate internal and external networks. Here the NAT provides local requests between devices directly connected to each other with internal protocols and reserved internal IP address (ex 192.168.1.102) but when internal devices want to communicate with external devices like on the internet, there has to be some translation that has to be done so that internal data can go out in the external network. The most simple form of such a translation is in the IP address i.e. the moment an internal device sends some data out, the NAT attaches an external IP address that belongs to the NAT itself and the server then replies to the NAT. The NAT then sends this response to the internal device using its internal IP address.

**Question 13** 1 Mark

Which of the following can be correctly described as the job of the Domain Name System?
- [ ] Convert human friendly domain names to respective IP addresses of the server
- [ ] Helps in backtracking an IP address back to its domain name (reverse DNS)
- [ ] Helps servers in maintaining and handling dynamic IP addresses so that the domain always points to the IP address at the specific time of request
- [x] All of the above

**Correct Answer:** D. All of the above

All of the above mentioned are the jobs of a DNS among many more things that a DNS does. Try reading more about what else a DNS does.

**Question 14** 1 Mark

In www.facebook.com. the server that represents the ‘.’ at the end signifies which of these?

 - [ ] Top Level Domain Server
 - [ ]  Authoritative Server
 - [ ]  Domain Name Server
 - [x]  Root Name Server

**Correct Answer:** D. Root Name Server

The ‘.’ at the end is called the root name and the server that represents the root name is called the Root Name Server. This is mostly hidden when you make web requests but you can assume all domains end with this invisible ‘.’.

**Question 15** 1 Mark

What is the subdomain in the following address: cdn.videos.facebook.com.
- [ ]  facebook
- [x]  videos
- [ ]  com
- [ ]  None of the above

**Correct Answer:** B. videos

Here ‘cdn’ and ‘videos’ are both subdomains of the domain facebook.com.

**Question 16** 1 Mark

What is the ‘.com’ in ‘www.facebook.com.’ called?
- [ ]  Authoritative Name
- [x]  Top Level Domain
- [ ]  Second Level Domain
- [ ]  None of the above

**Correct Answer:** B. Top Level Domain

‘.com’ is called the Top Level Domain or TLD, which is the highest level in the DNS hierarchy. The Root Name Server (the invisible “.” at the end) keeps the records of all TLDs under it and similarly the TLDs store the details of all the Authoritative Name Servers (facebook in this case) which then stores the details of all the sub-domains under Facebook. Second Level domains are special cases where there are domains between the TLD and Authoritative Name servers like google.co.in.

**Question 17** 1 Mark

DNS protocol uses TCP because it needs to be reliable.
- [ ]  True
- [x]  False

**Correct Answer:** B. False

DNS protocol is based upon UDP since UDP is fast and unreliable. Why it is okay to be unreliable is because when your device makes a UDP request to resolve a domain like google.com, the response must come immediately in milliseconds instead of taking time to create complete connection. If a packet drops which is common with UDP, the request can always be sent again.

**Question 18** 1 Mark

Milit needs a document to be printed. So he sends the file to the printer. What node is the printer behaving as in this case?
- [ ]  Client
- [x]  Server

**Correct Answer:** B. Server

You are requesting a print job and the printer is giving you the print service. Hence, the printer is a server in this case.

**Question 19** 1 Mark

Which port does the SMTP service run on?
- [ ]  443
- [ ]  21
- [ ]  20
- [x]  25

**Correct Answer:** D. 25

Port 25 is commonly used for SMTP service.

**Question 20** 1 Mark

Which of the following is a valid port number?
- [ ]  65536
- [x]  0
- [ ]  1.2
- [ ]  95663

**Correct Answer:** B. 0

The ports range between 0-65535 (both included). Hence there are a total of 65536 ports. Though 65536 is not a valid port, 0 is. 1.2 is not a ports since only whole numbers are, and 95663 > 65535 which is again an invalid port number.

**Question 21** 1 Mark

Which of these protocols is used to run system commands on a device and is used for remote administration?
- [ ]  SMTP
- [ ]  IMAP
- [ ]  VOIP
- [x]  Telnet

**Correct Answer:** D. Telnet

Telnet is used to remotely run system commands on a device. It enables a user to access a device remotely and run command on it just like you run them on your command prompt (cmd). If you want to run commands using telnet on a device, it needs to run the telnet service on port 23 and hence becomes the server, whereas you become the client who is connecting to the service using a telnet client software.

**Question 22** 1 Mark

Which layer of the OSI model is used to convert all data into electrical signals?
- [ ] Transport Layer
- [ ]  Application Layer
- [ ]  Network Layer
- [x]  Physical Layer

**Correct Answer:** D. Physical Layer

Physical Layer is the last layer that receives the data you input on the client side, and once all data has been converted into bits via the layers above it, the physical layer i.e the hardware device (ethernet adaptor, bluetooth adaptor, wifi adaptor) converts it to electrical/radio signals and transmits it through the medium (wire/wireless).

**Question 23** 1 Mark

ICMP protocol is used for which of these purposes?
- [ ]  For assigning IP address
- [x]  For deliverability and debugging
- [ ]  For conversion between IP and MAC addresses
- [ ]  None of the above

**Correct Answer:** B. For deliverability and debugging

DHCP is used for assigning IP addresses, ARP for conversion between IP and MAC addresses, and ICMP is used for debugging network stability and deliverability.

**Question 24** 1 Mark

TCP is ___________.
- [x]  Connection Oriented  
- [ ] Connectionless

**Correct Answer:** A. Connection Oriente TCP is connection-oriented because connections must be established before the transmission begins and destroyed when the communication finishes. Whereas, UDP is connectionless and no connection has to be created or destroyed before communication. The data is simply sent and if it gets lost, it is just retransmitted.

**Question 25** 1 Mark

UDP is reliable
- [ ]  True
- [x]  False

**Correct Answer:** B. False

TCP is reliable while UDP is not. In TCP the sender sends the packet, then waits for confirmation from the receiver, telling if the packet was fine or not. If the receiver tells that the packet did not come or was damaged, in TCP, it is retransmitted. This is done for each packet and until packet 1 does not reach properly packet 2 is not sent. This makes TCP reliable but slow, whereas, incase of UDP, all datagrams are sent altogether in a ‘fire and forget’ manner and no per packet inspection is done. If an appropriate response doesn’t come, the data is simply sent again. This makes UDP unreliable but fast.

**Question 26** 1 Mark

Which layer in the OSI model attaches the source and destination MAC addresses?
- [ ]  Physical Layer 
- [ ] Transport Layer
- [x]  Data Link Layer
- [ ]  Network Layer

**Correct Answer:** C. Data Link Layer

The Data Link Layer attaches the source and destination MAC addresses, which are used to identify the hardware of the device. It also calculates checksums for error checking of the metadata that has been attached at all the previous layers, and also to manage the flow of data. When the packet is received, the Data Link layer then strips the MAC address and forwards the packet to the Network layer.

**Question 27** 1 Mark

Which of these are uses of a proxy server?

- [ ] To block malicious traffic
- [ ]   To monitor web traffic
- [ ]   To bypass browsing restrictions
- [ ]  To hide IP address from the receiver
- [x] All of the above

**Correct Answer:** E. All of the above

A proxy server is a device or service which acts as an intermediate gateway via which one device can communicate with other devices via the proxy in the middle. As all traffic goes through it and it can read the requests and responses, it can be used to monitor and analyse web traffic and block malicious traffic. Moreover as for you and your ISP, you are simply communicating with the proxy server and if you visit a blocked website via the proxy, the ISP won’t know and similarly the website will only see the IP address of the proxy and not you.
