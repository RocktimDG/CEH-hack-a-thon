 1. Vyom has recently learnt how to use some tools on websites to find vulnerabilities. In an attempt to impress his computer teacher and get appreciation he starts testing on the college website. But, alas, his teacher one day catches him after school hours in the computer lab, testing the college website. What can the college do?
 
	 - [ ] Since he had no malicious intent, there is no background to build up a legal case against Vyom.
	 - [x] His college authorities can in fact file a case against him under the Indian Cyber Law for testing on their website without proper consent.
 
	>**Explanation:**
	> Even if you mean no harm, an organization, in this case the college authorities, under the Indian Cyber Law, can file a case against you if you choose to test their website without consent. Though, if you don't misuse a loophole and neither cause any damage while looking for it, most organizations will appreciate your effort. But, one must not take their chances when legal matters are concerned. Better to be safe, than sorry.
