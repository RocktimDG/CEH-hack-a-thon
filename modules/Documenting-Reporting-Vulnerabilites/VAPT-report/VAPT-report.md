# Types of Report
Let’s look at the key parts of a Detailed Developer Report:

- Index of all the vulnerabilities.
- Information about what exact URL and parameters are affected.
- The payload you used to confirm the vulnerability.
- Observations (screenshots/videos) explaining a complete step by step exploitation of each vulnerability.
- Outcome (if any) i.e. the data you were able to extract using the vulnerability, commands you were able to run, etc.
- Business Impact - A detailed description of the impact of the vulnerability with examples (screenshots/videos).
- Recommendations on how to patch the vulnerability.
- References about the vulnerability, including links explaining the vulnerability, the patches and the impact.

Let’s look at the key parts of a High Level Management Summary:

- Information summarising everything a hacker can do if an attack happens, containing maximum possible impacts of each vulnerability (multiple if they exist).
- Information about what exact URL and parameters are affected.
- Brief observations containing only the application affected and impact information i.e no step by step guide is required, but only outcome observations.
- Detailed business impact with proofs of all kind of information you extracted during the exploitation.
- References about the vulnerabilities (not the patches).
